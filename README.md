# Calculator-AI

## 🚀 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to test and explore how different AI tools can work together to create a full application without human coding. 

I chose a calculator app as the first project because I know its rules and logic very well. This makes it easier to focus on using the AI tools, instead of thinking too much about the app itself.

In this project, I wanted to understand how to:
- plan the app idea with AI,
- design the UI with AI tools,
- write and refactor code with AI help,
- and test how well these tools can build an app with little or no human writing.

It is also a way for me to practice using these tools and learn how to include them in my future software development process.


## 🤖 Used AI Tools

In this project, I used different AI tools at each step of the development process. Each tool helped me with a specific task:

- **ChatGPT**  
  I used ChatGPT to plan the project. It helped me write the first version of the project idea, break it into smaller parts, and prepare a to-do list. It was like having a smart teammate who understands what I want to build.

- **Stitch UI**  
  After the plan was ready, I used Stitch to turn the idea into a visual design. With Stitch, I created simple UI components and layouts. It gave me a quick and clean Figma export to use as a base.

- **Lovable**  
  I took the Figma export from Stitch and gave it to Lovable. Lovable turned the design into real frontend code. This saved me a lot of time and made it easy to move from design to code.

- **Cursor**  
  I used Cursor to write and improve the full application code. It helped me add features, fix bugs, and refactor the code. Cursor works inside a code editor and gives smart suggestions. It felt like a real coding partner during development.

By using these tools together, I could go from idea to working app with almost no manual coding. Each tool had a role, and combining them made the process much faster and easier.

## ⌛ Development Timeline & Commentary

| Stage | Tool(s) Used | Approx. Time | Personal Notes |
|-------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Planning | ChatGPT | ~1 hour | Quickly distilled ideas into a clear roadmap and task list. |
| UI Design | Stitch UI | ~15 minutes | A single prompt produced a polished Figma mock-up; only minor spacing tweaks were necessary. |
| Code Generation | Lovable | ~10 minutes | Converted the Figma file into clean React/TypeScript code ready to run. |
| Coding & Refinement | Cursor | Continuous | Served as an AI pair-programmer; bug fixes and feature iterations took seconds to minutes. |


## ⚙️ AI-Based Development Workflow

In this project, I followed a full development workflow using AI tools. Each step had a different focus, and I used the right AI tool for each part. Below, you can see each step and what kind of output it created.

---

### 1. 🧠 Planning with ChatGPT

- I started with ChatGPT to plan the project idea.
- I asked questions like "What features should a calculator app have?"
- ChatGPT helped me write a list of steps and explained the project structure.
- I also discussed design ideas and which tools to use.

**Goal:** Create a clear and simple roadmap for the project.

**Extracted Output:**
- A feature list (Basic calculator operations, Clear button, UI layout idea)
- A project task list (Plan → Design → Generate Code → Finalize Logic)
- A tool stack suggestion (Stitch, Lovable, Cursor, etc.)

---

### 2. 🎨 UI Design with Stitch AI

- After the planning, I used Stitch to design the user interface.
- I wrote a prompt to describe how the calculator should look.
- Stitch created clean and modern UI components.
- I exported the UI design as a Figma file.

**Goal:** Turn the idea into a real visual layout.

**Extracted Output:**
- A Figma design file for the calculator
- A UI structure with buttons, screen display, and layout positions
- Responsive design with Bootstrap-like styling

### 3. 🧩 Code Generation with Lovable

- I gave the Figma file to Lovable to generate frontend code.
- It produced clean HTML/CSS/React code based on the design.
- This saved me time and helped me start with a working layout.

**Goal:** Convert UI design into real code with zero manual effort.

**Extracted Output:**
- A full React component for the calculator UI
- CSS styles for layout and buttons
- Clean folder structure for the frontend project

### 4. 🛠️ Code Completion & Improvements with Cursor

- I used Cursor to write the logic of the calculator.
- Cursor helped me add features like button actions, calculations, and input display.
- It also helped me fix bugs and clean the code.
- I asked for code improvements and Cursor explained the changes clearly.

**Goal:** Finish the full application with AI support inside the code editor.

**Extracted Output:**
- Functional JavaScript/TypeScript code for calculator logic
- Refactored React components with better structure
- Comments and small fixes automatically applied by Cursor

### How It All Fits Together

1. **UI Generation (Lovable)** – The initial calculator layout lives mainly inside `src/components/Calculator.tsx` plus the panel components (`BasicPanel.jsx`, `ScientificPanel.jsx`, etc.).
2. **State Management** – Button actions and calculation logic are colocated inside the panel components to keep them easy to reason about. Any shared helpers live in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
3. **Styling** – Tailwind CSS classes are used directly within JSX. The design tokens exported by Lovable were converted into Tailwind utilities for consistency.
4. **Routing & Pages** – Minimal routing is handled by React-Router; the `Index` page renders the `Calculator` component, while `NotFound` is a simple fallback route.
